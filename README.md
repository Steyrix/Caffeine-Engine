### Caffeine Engine

This project is my humble playground to test out interesting gamedev patterns I run into while browsing the net.

However, I aim to create usable simple engine, that will, hopefully, allow me to create basic games and gain overall experience in gamedev.

My first iteration of engine-creating can be seen in simple-jogl-engine repository, which is based on JOGL,
his project, on the other hand, will use LWJGL OpenGL binding, since the latter is not as dead as the former.

#### Used technologies: 
- OpenGL
- GLFW
